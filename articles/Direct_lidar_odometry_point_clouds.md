## Abstract
 Field robotics in perceptually-challenging environments require fast and accurate state estimation, but modern
LiDAR sensors quickly overwhelm current odometry algorithms.
To this end, this paper presents a lightweight frontend LiDAR
odometry solution with consistent and accurate localization for
computationally-limited robotic platforms. Our Direct LiDAR
Odometry (DLO) method includes several key algorithmic innovations which prioritize computational efficiency and enables
the use of dense, minimally-preprocessed point clouds to provide accurate pose estimates in real-time. This is achieved
through a novel keyframing system which efficiently manages
historical map information, in addition to a custom iterative
closest point solver for fast point cloud registration with data
structure recycling. Our method is more accurate with lower
computational overhead than the current state-of-the-art and has
been extensively evaluated in multiple perceptually-challenging
environments on aerial and legged robots as part of NASA
JPL Team CoSTARâ€™s research and development efforts for the
DARPA Subterranean Challenge.
